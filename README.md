This repository will hold the code for the Design Principles and Methods project

In order for us all to work together, we have to do some setup. Here's the scoop.

We all have different versions of eclipse and different locations for things on our computer. The only thing that we actually need to share is all of our code. Everything else, like your eclipse prefferences (generated for you when you make a project) we don't actually need (lets hope).

What we are going to do is set up our eclipse in such a way that we share the src folder.

The goal is that you can open the Github desktop app, press sync, and then you will get the latest changes to our 'shared src folder', and begin to contribute to it as well!

After you press the sync button, you can open eclipse and all of the new files and folders that were created by other people will be there.

Before we do this however, some setup has to happen. 

//TODO write the steps for this...
